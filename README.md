### Hi there 👋


I am Thao Nguyen - a senior student at National Economics University. I am majoring in Data Science in Economics and Business (DSEB) and especially interested in Nature Language Processing. 

- 🔭 I am currently working as a research member of ASPIRE Project of the World Bank with the aim to improve Social Protection and Labor (SPL) data quality, comparability, and availability to better inform SPL policies and programs.  
- 🌱 I’m currently improving myself. I have two female idols, Huyen Chip (Computer Scientist) and Giang Oi (Content Creator), from whom I am learning valuable lessons in order to become a better person.
